### Do yourself a favor, remove distracting feeds
In a world full of information, you're still capable of finding uninformed people.
News feeds might give the illusion of informing you, however you will find yourself lost.
From misinformation, to pointless uninteresting content, to a barrage of ads every few posts, news feeds do more harm than they are able to offer.
This extension aims to remove them completely, that way you're able to focus more on what matters to you.
We're aware however, it's not so simple. This extension allows you to re-activate news feeds for a set amount of time.
